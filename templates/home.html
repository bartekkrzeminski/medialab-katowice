		<p>The Katowice Special Economic Zone started from 800ha of former agricultural, industrial and wasteland areas in Silesia. As part of the broader revitalisation agenda for region formerly burdened with heavy industry, it was supposed to bring modern companies, innovation and employment opportunities.
		</p>
			<div class="iframe" data-ratio="1.9" data-src="http://cf.datawrapper.de/6YWic/2/"></div>

		<p>The Zone now comprises over 2000ha of industrial space, roughly 13% of the total area of economic zones in Poland, offering 50’000 jobs, mostly in automotive industry. Over ¾ of work positions in SEZ are new, the remainder classified as work positions preserved. In 2012 there were 227 active permits for operating in economic zone, compared to only 49 at the turn of millenia. 
		</p>

		<p>
		Companies in the zone invest substantially more per employee than the average company outside, in 2012 making over twice as much investment per employee. This testifies to the role of SEZ as a catalyst for investment.

		<p>While the zone is a substantial contributor to employment and investment to the area, substantial tax allowances were decreed to the SEZ entrants in Poland. Over the period 1996-2012 tax exemptions summed to a figure north of 10bn PLN. With Katowice Special Economic Zone being a roughly 20% of Polish economic zones in terms of size, the back of the envelope calculation suggests 2bn PLN over the 16 years, or 130m PLN per annum, offered in the form of public support to companies involved. The 20bn PLN of investment made within the Special Economic zone seem like a good rationale for such sizable public outlay, but it remains elusive whether this investment would not happen had it not been for the economic zone.
