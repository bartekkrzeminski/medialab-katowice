		<p>The Katowice Special Economic Zone started from 800ha of former agricultural, industrial and wasteland areas in Silesia. As part of the broader revitalisation agenda for region formerly burdened with heavy industry, it was supposed to bring modern companies, innovation and employment opportunities.
		</p>
			<div class="iframe" data-ratio="1.9" data-src="http://cf.datawrapper.de/6YWic/2/"></div>

		<p>The Zone now comprises over 2000ha of industrial space, roughly 13% of the total area of economic zones in Poland, offering 50’000 jobs, mostly in automotive industry. Over ¾ of work positions in SEZ are new, the remainder classified as work positions preserved. In 2012 there were 227 active permits for operating in economic zone, compared to only 49 at the turn of millenia. 
		</p>

		<p>
		Companies in the zone invest substantially more per employee than the average company outside, in 2012 making over twice as much investment per employee. This testifies to the role of SEZ as a catalyst for investment.

		<p>While the zone is a substantial contributor to employment and investment to the area, substantial tax allowances were decreed to the SEZ entrants in Poland. Over the period 1996-2012 tax exemptions summed to a figure north of 10bn PLN. With Katowice Special Economic Zone being a roughly 20% of Polish economic zones in terms of size, the back of the envelope calculation suggests 2bn PLN over the 16 years, or 130m PLN per annum, offered in the form of public support to companies involved. The 20bn PLN of investment made within the Special Economic zone seem like a good rationale for such sizable public outlay, but it remains elusive whether this investment would not happen had it not been for the economic zone.

		<p>Companies and factories in the KSSE have had a long history of violating workers rights. Employees often referred to the Katowice Special Economic Zone as a, “labor camp zone”. Common workers – those people who should have most benefits from the creation of the KSSE (in the words of politicians and CEO’s) – are complaining about shockingly low wages, mobbing, inhuman work conditions and junk job contracts without any social benefits. Thousands of mostly anonymous internet comments written by KSSE workers below articles about the SEZ or on portals dedicated to exchanging opinions about employers and companies, paints a very dark picture of working conditions in KSSE. Those bitter opinions are consistent with major independent reports, depicting work in Special Economic Zones as a modern form of slavery.</p>

		<p>Still, big workers strikes in the KSSE are rather uncommon. Trade unions, especially in smaller factories and companies are virtually non-existent, so workers have no official representation. In the last few years Polish media publicized material only on three important strikes. The first was at the BMZ Poland factory in Sosnowiec  ---strike against mobbing unionists in factory). The second was at Bitorn company in Sosnowiec where strikers were protesting low wages, junk job contracts and inhuman work conditions. Lastly, since 2007, there have been multiple strikes at Fiat Autopoland Tychy  – one of the biggest companies working in the KSSE. The irony of it? This is the same factory where workers in 1992 participated in the longest sit-down strike in modern Polish history and one of the most important effects of this strike was the beginning of negotiations about building Katowice Special Economic Zone.</p>
